<h1>Starting and Quitting GrADS</h1>

GrADS is started by entering the command: <a
href="gradcomdgrads.html"><code>grads</code></a><p>

Before initialising the graphics output environment, GrADS will
prompt for landscape or portrait mode.  Landscape is 11 x 8.5
inches (usually what you want).  Portrait is 8.5 x 11 inches,
primarily used for producing vertically oriented hardcopy output. 
The actual size of the window will not, of course,  be 11 x 8.5
inches (or 8.5 x 11 inches), but instead will be whatever size
you chose by using your workstation's window manager.  But GrADS
will treat the window as if it were one of the above sizes, so it
is best to size the window with approximately the proper aspect
ratio.  This can be done using the window manager or from GrADS
using the command:<p>

<dd><code>set xsize x y</code><p>

which resizes the window to <code>x,y</code> pixels.<p>

After answering this prompt, a separate graphics output window
will be opened (but not on PCs). You may move or resize this
window at any time.<p>

You will enter GrADS commands in the text window from where you
started GrADS.  Graphics output will appear in the graphics
window in response to the commands you enter.  You will thus need
to make the text window the "active" window; the window that
receives keyboard input.<p>

<h2><u>Help</u></h2>

Typing <code>help</code> at the GrADS command prompt gives a summary list of
operations essential to do anything in GrADS.  This is intended
to jog memory rather than provide an exhaustive help facility. If
the GrADS manual is not available, you can obtain info on most
command parameters by typing the command on its own. 
Alternatively, we are setting up comprehensive documentation
intended to be used as a local Web facility.<p>
<br>
<h2><u>Diagnostics at startup</u></h2>

When you start GrADS you get platform specific diagnostics, for
example:<p>

<ul>
<code>
GX Package Initialization: Size = 11 8.5 <br>
!!!! 32-bit BIG ENDIAN machine version <br>
ga></code></ul><p>

The <code>!!!!</code> line tells you that this version is <code>32-bit</code> 
(i.e., data
are 32-bit) and it was compiled for a <code>big endian</code> machine (the Sun
in this case).  On the Cray you get...<p>

<dd><code>!!!! 64-BIT MACHINE VERSION (CRAYS)</code><P>
<br>
<h2><u>Startup options</u></h2>

You may specify the following options as arguments to the
<a href="gradcomdgrads.html"><code>grads</code></a>
command when GrADS is started:<p>

<ul>
<code>-b</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Run grads in batch mode.  No graphics output
window is opened. <br>
<code>-l</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Run grads in landscape mode.  The Portrait
vs. Landscape question is not asked. <br>
<code>-p</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Run grads in portrait mode. <br>
<code>-c</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Execute the supplied command as the 1 st  GrADS
command after GrADS is started.</ul><p>

An example:<p>

<dd><code>grads -c "run profile.gs"</code><p>

These options may be used in combinations.  For example:<p>

<dd><code>grads -blc "run batch.gs"</code><p>

Would run grads in batch mode, using landscape orientation (thus
no questions are asked at startup); and execute the command:<p>

<dd><code>batch.gs</code> upon startup.<p>
<br>

<h2><u>Leaving GrADS</u></h2>

To leave GrADS, enter the command:<p>

<dd><code>quit</code>
