                       GrADS Executables for UNIX

The executables contained in this tar file are typically placed in the
directory /usr/local/bin. If you do not have write permission for your
/usr/local/bin directory, you can put them in the ~/bin subdirectory of your home
directory.

     cd /usr/local/bin
     gunzip tarfile.gz
     tar xvf tarfile

After unpacking the first tar file, you should have the following executables:

     grads            GrADS - The basic package
     gradsdap         GrADS enabled to read data remotely via OPeNDAP
     gribmap          Creates an index file that "maps" a GRIB data set for a GrADS descriptor file
     gribscan         Extracts grid info from a GRIB data set
     grib2scan        Extracts grid info from a GRIB2 data set
     bufrscan         Reads BUFR messages and prints out ascii values 
     gxps             Converts GrADS metafiles to Postscript
     gxeps            Converts GrADS metafiles to Encapsulated Postscript
     gxtran           Displays metafiles
     stnmap           Maps station data
     wgrib            See http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/wgrib.html

A second tar file (data.tar.Z) contains the GrADS fonts and maps data sets is 
also necessary and can be downloaded from http://grads.iges.org/grads/downloads.html.

The contents of data.tar are typically placed in the directory
/usr/local/lib/grads, the default location for these files. If you do not have
write permission for /usr/local/lib/grads, you can place the files elsewhere, but
you must also change the environment variable GADDIR so the GrADS executables will
know where to find these files.

     cd dirname
     uncompress data.tar.Z
     tar xvf data.tar
     setenv GADDIR dirname (If dirname is not /usr/local/lib/grads)
